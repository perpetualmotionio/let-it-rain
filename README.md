# About

Let It Rain is an interactive Kinect + Processing display that simulates being
in a thunderstorm. Inspiration for this project was based on inspiration from a small
Kinect demo called [KinectRain](https://github.com/taromorimoto/KinectRain) and
a [sketch on OpenProcessing](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/2924).
