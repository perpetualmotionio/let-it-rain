# About

Let It Rain is an interactive Kinect + Processing display that simulates being
in a thunderstorm. Inspiration for this project was based on a small
Kinect demo, [KinectRain](https://github.com/taromorimoto/KinectRain).

## Todo

* Scale image to another resolution
* Add lightning streaks
* Use logarithmically decreasing function (instead of linear) to change lighting fill
* Add color
